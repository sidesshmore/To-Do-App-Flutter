## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create new tasks by providing a title and optional description. They can also mark tasks as completed, update task details, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

- **Task Filtering**: The app provides options to filter tasks based on their completion status. Users can choose to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only pending tasks.

- **Task Priority**: Each task can be assigned a priority level (low, medium, or high), allowing users to prioritize their tasks accordingly.

- **Date and Time**: Tasks can be associated with a specific due date and time. Users can set reminders for important tasks to ensure they don't miss any deadlines.

- **Data Persistence**: The app stores task data locally, ensuring that tasks remain accessible even if the app is closed or the device is restarted.
